### 2. User Roles

- **Uploading User**: uploads content, sets the access price, and is solely responsible for the legality and rights related to the content.
- **Accessing User**: pays for and receives one-time or time-limited access to content.

### 3. Payments

All payments are processed via **Stripe**.

Payments are automatically divided between:

The Operator bears no responsibility for user-uploaded content.
